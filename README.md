# Disclaimer
*This is a toy-project. I had fun doing this library but these are not real monads which you could use in _Haskell_. I just tried to adopt the idea of computations with side effect from _Haskell_ to _Elixir_ with minimal overhead to the syntax.*

# Monads

This is an implementation of the `Try` and `Maybe` monads. Please see tests for examples.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `el_monads` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:el_monads, "~> 0.1.0"}]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/el_monads](https://hexdocs.pm/el_monads).
